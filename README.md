🚀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 💓
I recently completed a data science project focused on predicting heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. This end-to-end project involved:

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified key trends and imbalances in features like age, cholesterol, and chest pain type

Handled missing values and visualized correlations using heatmaps and boxplots

🛠 Preprocessing:

Encoded categorical variables and imputed missing data

Converted the target into a binary classification problem (disease vs. no disease)

🌲 Modeling with Random Forest:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier for binary prediction

Evaluated with Accuracy, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix, and Feature Importance

Also experimented with a Random Forest Regressor to predict severity (0–4) using R² and RMSE

📊 Results:

Achieved strong performance and insights into the most predictive features (e.g., chest pain, ST depression)

🙏 Special thanks to Madhubala Ma'am for her invaluable guidance, mentorship, and support throughout this project. Your teaching made a complex process both clear and rewarding.
